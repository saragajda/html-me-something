      <p>We drove to the Olympic Peninsula from Seattle early this morning and got our tents set up at Kalaloch Beach Campground.</p>

      <p>After setting up and eating lunch, we drove to Ruby Beach, which was about 15 minutes north. We climbed over giant driftwood logs bleached white by the sun to access the beach. We explored tidepools and tried to stay warm before heading back to the campsite.</p>
